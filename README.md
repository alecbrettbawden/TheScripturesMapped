Project 2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I enjoyed Project 2 more than I enjoyed Project 1. I felt as though I learned more from this project with CSS than I have ever known through previous classes 
and studying that I have done. I enjoyed the challenge and freedom of changing animations. I felt that the videos for the animations help were really what kickstarted
me being able to understand what was working. I tried a few different things that didn't work and learned a lot from those experience as well. Ultimately, I know that
I did not implement the transition slides and the cross fade as efficiently as I could have. I'm curious to see Dr. Liddle's solution to how he did this. The video
made one way transitions such as going forward a chapter very easy to understand, but adding the dynamic of going backward and forward or going to a new book made it much more difficult. 
    As far as people I showed this to, I showed this to a few co-workers. The overall impression was that the site was impressive. Once, however, I pointed out some 
issues, they all agreed that fixing small bugs in the transitions or aesthetic features would improve the experience for them. Ultimately I tried very hard to figure
out one specific bug that I couldn't with the cross fades. I have debugged my code and it seems to be working properly just for some reason the crossfade animation
does not happen when a user is navigating from several chapters away. Other than this, the cross fade works. It's a weird bug that I haven't solved yet.
